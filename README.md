just trying




I am looking to force close a txt file that is opened by another process. Looking for suggestions, ideas on how this can be accomplished, and the caveats involved. 
Python solution would be great, however other programming languages are fine as well. I am able to list the process, and how many files that are opened by that process, but going blank on how to close that file.
